Advertising Creative is the first ‚Äúpostdigital‚Äù creative strategy and copywriting textbook in which digital technology is woven throughout every chapter. The book gets right to the point of advertising by stressing key principles and practical information students and working professionals can use to communicate effectively in this postdigital age. Drawing on personal experience as award-winning experts in creative advertising, Tom Altstiel and Jean Grow offer real-world insights on cutting-edge topics, including global, social media, business-to-business, in-house, and small agency advertising. In this Fourth Edition, Altstiel and Grow take a deeper dive into the exploration of digital technology and its implications for the industry, as they expose the pervasive changes experienced across the global advertising landscape. Their most important revelation of all is the identification of the three qualities that will define the future leaders of this industry: Be a risk taker. Understand technology. Live for ideas.
