This Barnes and Noble Exclusive Edition includes the bonus feature, ‚ÄúA Reaper&amp;#039;s Guide.‚Äù This pamphlet serves as an introduction to reaping and lays out the basics on how new reapers are expected to guide humans from the end of life to the beginning of eternity. From TJ Klune, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The House in the Cerulean Sea, comes Under the Whispering Door, a new contemporary fantasy about a ghost who refuses to cross over and the ferryman he falls in love with.

 When a reaper comes to collect Wallace Price from his own funeral, Wallace suspects he really might be dead.

 Instead of leading him directly to the afterlife, the reaper takes him to a small village. On the outskirts, off the path through the woods, tucked between mountains, is a particular tea shop, run by a man named Hugo. Hugo is the tea shop&amp;#039;s owner to locals and the ferryman to souls who need to cross over.

 But Wallace isn‚Äôt ready to abandon the life he barely lived. With Hugo‚Äôs help he finally starts to learn about all the things he missed in life.

 When the Manager, a curious and powerful being, arrives at the tea shop and gives Wallace one week to cross over, Wallace sets about living a lifetime in seven days.

 By turns heartwarming and heartbreaking, this absorbing tale of grief and hope is told with TJ Klune&amp;#039;s signature warmth, humor, and extraordinary empathy.
