Overview
An innovative, field-tested framework for leaders and managers on how to create more diverse leadership and management teams.

 
 We need the strength that comes from diversity more now than we ever have in our collective memory. Without leadership teams that reflect the full range of humanity, for-profit and nonprofit organizations alike will find it more difficult to confront todayâ€™s challenges and are unlikely to thrive in the long term. But no two organizations have the same need for greater diversity in leadership nor the same path to achieving it. In The Leaders You Need, Karen Brown offers an innovative, field-tested ABCD Framework that will help readers to discover the hidden leadership and management talent in their organizationsâ€”and how to harness it.
 
 Karen Brown shares the approach she has used to guide organizations from small nonprofits to the Global 500 on their journey to greater diversity in leadership and management. Her framework consists of four pillars:
 â€¢ How to align diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts with business priorities
 â€¢ How to build strong partnerships with stakeholders
 â€¢ How to cultivate a culture of role models
 â€¢ How to define objectives and outcomes with data
 Readers will learn how to use the framework to identify and dismantle the barriers to greater leadership and management diversity in their organizations. Whatâ€™s more, they will get practical advice on how to become inclusive leaders who create opportunities for everyone on their teams to learn, grow, and fulfill their potential.
