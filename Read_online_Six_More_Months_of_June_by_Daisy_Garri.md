A romantic debut about the exhilarating highs and messy lows that swirl together when high school comes to an end, perfect for fans of Carley Fortune and Jenny Han

 Golden boy Caplan and bookish Mina have been unlikely soulmates since third grade. Bound by growing up in single-mother households on the same cul-de-sac in Two Docks, Michigan, their friendship exists miraculously outside their high schoolâ€™s social order. Mina is class valedictorian, expected by her late fatherâ€™s parents to attend his Ivy alma mater; Caplan is laughing off prom-king predictions and the fear that heâ€™s peaking too soon.
 
 When Capâ€™s skateboard-toting, detention-dodging best friend confesses his feelings for Mina, she is whisked into a social life she never imagined, bumping shoulders with the likes of Caplanâ€™s queen-bee girlfriend. Caplan is determined that things stay just as theyâ€™ve always been, while Mina faces the perils and privileges of opening her heart just in time to say goodbye.
 
 As the sun sets on senior year, everything glows. What will Cap and Mina discover in the last-chance light?
