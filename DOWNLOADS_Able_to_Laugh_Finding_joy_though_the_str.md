Overview
Q: Why is your wife in a wheelchair? A: Because she can&#039;t walk. Q: Why were you ironing in the nude anyway?
 A: No wait, I can explain... Q: Why would this happen to you?
 A: Why wouldn&#039;t it? People ask the silliest things. But for Jade and John Reynolds it&#039;s the silence surrounding disability that&#039;s the strangest of all. When Jade unexpectedly suffered from a rare condition which left her paralysed and in a wheelchair at the age of twelve, she never imagined that she&#039;d one day meet her husband John and that together they would take to social media to dispel the stigma surrounding disability, one story at a time. From questions about suffering and sex to family and faith, Jade and John speak honestly and humorously about life as an inter-able couple. And here, they bring together the big questions (and big jokes) that have made them so popular online onto the page in a debut book that will help you reframe your hardship into reasons to hope. It&#039;s time to discover that no matter what life throws at you, you are truly, able to laugh.
